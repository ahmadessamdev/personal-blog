A responsive vantage WordPress theme created while learning theme design and development years ago. I designed and developed it from scratch without using frameworks (except for styling, I used bootstrap).

It had a classic simple design. It was installable using the WordPress menu. It worked great!
It was a learning project, but it needs some updates to work with the latest WordPress version.
