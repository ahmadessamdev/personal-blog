I developed this WordPress plugin and published it for years on the WordPress plugin directory. It was fetching the latest news from Aljazeera Arabic Website using RSS. It utilizes SimplePie script which is already integrated into WordPress.

I added some options to the widget menus and it worked great. I kept updating the plugin for years. Currently, I stopped developing it and started, but the source code is available on GitHub.
