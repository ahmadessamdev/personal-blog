I developed an internal system for a training center handling several internal tasks.

Tasks of the system include registering students, keeping a profile of each student, saving students' results, and displaying exam results for the students.<br><br>The design of the system started with Database Design using MySQL, which required several meetings with the staff to understand the requirements of the system. The second step was to find a suitable Bootstrap theme and do some Front-End work for displaying basic data, then the Back-End development using the PHP language and Code Igniter framework. I cycled for months through these stages, adding features and improving.

The work seemed slow and without something to show the stuff at the beginning, but when the results came out, and they started working on it, they felt like it could ease up the process of their daily work. They were happy working with it.
