      <title>How to recover a corrupted flash memory using F3 tools under Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This tutorial requires Linux. If you want to test your flash under windows check out: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/test-and-detect-fake-or-counterfeit-usb-flash-drives-bought-from-ebay-with-h2testw&#34;&gt;test-and-detect-fake-flash-with-h2testw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you have a corrupted flash memory, you copy files into it and when you try to open it later, they don&amp;rsquo;t work. There are number of reasons for this problem, one of them is aging, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Write_endurance&#34;&gt;flash memories have a lifetime too&lt;/a&gt; and there is a limited number of writes. If this was the cause of the problem, then it is time to retire it. Another reason could be that you have a counterfeit or defected flash, I will show you how to get something out of it in this case, but don&amp;rsquo;t expect much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Arabic Case Insensitive In Database Systems: How To Solve Alef With and Without Hamza Problem</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started learning database systems, I ran into problems dealing with Arabic text in databases. Since these problems were specific to the Arabic language, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily find solutions on the internet. I try in this post to summarize the solutions I know to a common Arabic text problem in database systems, hoping it will help someone struggling to deal with Arabic text in databases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have characters which are considered the same in Arabic (like Alef &lt;code&gt;&#39;ا&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and Alef without Hamza &lt;code&gt;&#39;أ&#39;&lt;/code&gt;), but these are two different characters in database systems. When you try to make a search function in your website, for example, you want to ignore the differences between these characters. The use of case-insensitive collation like &lt;code&gt;utf8_unicode_ci&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;rsquo;t solve the problem. The &lt;code&gt;&#39;ا&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;أ&#39;&lt;/code&gt; aren&amp;rsquo;t considered equal in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://collation-charts.org/mysql60/mysql604.utf8_unicode_ci.middle_eastern.html&#34;&gt;character mapping&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;utf8_unicode_ci&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
